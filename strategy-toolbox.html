            <h2>Problem-Solving Strategy</h2>
            <p>Typically when I am approached with a new Algorithms problem to solve I work through a series of steps. All of these steps stem from one very key first step: always start with working through a small example (or a few) from there you have a few different ways to strategize your thinking.</p>
            
            <h2>Key Steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>When first starting, always work from a small example and try solving it by hand. Think through what you have to do as a human to identify your answer. Are you doing anything that could be turned into a repeatable process?</li>
                <li>Does this problem seem like something you could solve if you knew the answer to a different instance of that problem? If so maybe use DP</li>
                <li>Do you need to repeat your process an arbitrary number of times? Maybe recursion is the way to go! Think through your base case.</li>
                <li>When starting to code using DP, start by constructing your search space, then think through identifying the ideal solutions.</li>
                <li>Identify waste: what work are you repeating or redoing more than once?</li>
                <li>Don't panic: even if you don't see the full solution, partial ideas often reveal patterns.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>What are algorithms?</strong> Algorithms are ways to create a series of repeatable actions that you can predictably take for any instance of a problem and get an expected output.</li>
                <li><strong>Start Small:</strong> Always begin with small examples and work your way up. This approach helps break down complex problems into manageable pieces and reveals patterns that might not be obvious at first glance.</li>
