            <p class="subtitle">Learn how to solve the Activity Selection Problem using greedy algorithms. This is a classic problem that helps us understand how to make optimal choices when scheduling activities.</p>

        <section class="problem-description">
            <h2>The Problem</h2>
            <p>You're given a list of activities. Each one has a start and end time. You want to attend as many as possible, but none of them can overlap. If one event ends at 11:00, the next one has to start at or after 11:00. Your goal is to come up with a strategy that picks the maximum number of non-overlapping events.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="example">
            <h2>Step 1: Start With a Small Example</h2>
            <div class="activity-list">
                <p>Swim practice: 10:00 AM – 11:00 AM</p>
                <p>Pottery class: 10:20 AM – 11:25 AM</p>
                <p>Baking workshop: 11:00 AM – 12:00 PM</p>
            </div>

            <p>Take a second and ask yourself: Which events would you choose if you wanted to fit in as many as possible? Try each of these options on your own and then click to get more information.</p>

            <div class="option-cards">
                <div class="option-card">

                            <li>It ends at 11:00, so next you could do baking (which starts at 11:00)</li>
                            <li>Pottery is out, it overlaps with swim</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>2 Final activities: Swim, Baking</p>

                        <h4>Step-by-Step Analysis:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pottery overlaps with both swim and baking</li>
                            <li>So you can't take anything else</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>1 Final activity: Pottery</p>

                    <p class="option-summary">Begin with the latest starting activity and work backwards.</p>
                    <button class="show-analysis-btn">Show Analysis</button>
                    <div class="option-details" style="display: none;">
                        <h4>Step-by-Step Analysis:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Swim ends at 11:00, which is when baking starts</li>
                            <li>That's a tight fit but allowed</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>2 Final activities: Swim, Baking</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>So far, the best outcome includes Swim and Baking. But we found that using our own intuition. Remember algorithms are all about being able to reliably repeat a series of actions to find the correct solution for every input. How can we turn your instincts into a reusable strategy?</p>

                <p>Guest lecture: 9:00 AM – 1:00 PM</p>

                            <li>Speed networking starts at 9:30 so it overlaps with Guest lecture and we can't add it</li>
                            <li>Quick coding session starts at 10:00 it also overlaps with Guest lecture so we can't add it</li>

                        </ul>

                        <h4>Step-by-Step Analysis:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Now look for the next event that starts after 9:45. That would be a Quick coding session, which starts at 10:00. Great, add it.</li>
                            <li>Guest lecture started way earlier and overlapped, so we skip it.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Total events attended: 2</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>Hmm how can we be sure which option is best when two ways of selecting the local maximum lead to the same global result? Will both options work the same every time? When multiple local strategies happen to produce the same global result, it's easy to assume they're all valid. This is exactly the kind of moment when it helps to go back to basics. Revisit Step 1, try another example, and see if the patterns still hold. The more edge cases you test, the clearer the winning strategy becomes.</p>
